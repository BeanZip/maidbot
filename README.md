# maidbot
wow you're actually reading this (might as well give you the commands you can use)


## /meow
Makes the bot meow. whichever meow you get is random (this includes the amount of `w`s you get)
## /console
Find some secret console commands to execute. Some require special permissions :3
## /vocaloid
Gives you a random vocaloid song the bot has saved. More will be added if I can collect them.
